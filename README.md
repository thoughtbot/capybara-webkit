capybara-webkit
===============

A [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) driver that uses [WebKit](http://webkit.org) via [QtWebKit](http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qtwebkit.html).

Dependencies
------------

capybara-webkit depends on a WebKit implementation from Qt, a cross-platform development toolkit. You'll need to download the Qt libraries to build and install the gem.

If you're on OS X, [download the non-debug Cocoa package](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/qt-for-open-source-cpp-development-on-mac-os-x). Note that installing Qt via homebrew takes more than an hour, so we don't recommend it.

If you're on Ubuntu, you can install the libqt4-dev package. For other Linux distributions, [download this package](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/linux-x11-cpp).

CI
--

If you're like us, you'll be using capybara-webkit on CI.

On Linux platforms, capybara-webkit requires an X server to run, although it doesn't create any visible windows. Xvfb works fine for this. You can setup Xvfb yourself and set a DISPLAY variable, or try out the [headless gem](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless).

Usage
-----

Add the capybara-webkit gem to your Gemfile:

    gem "capybara-webkit"

Set your Capybara Javascript driver to webkit:

    Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit

Tag scenarios with @javascript to run them using a headless WebKit browser.
