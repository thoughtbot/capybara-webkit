[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit)

A [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) driver that uses [WebKit](http://webkit.org) via [QtWebKit](http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit).

Qt Dependency and Installation Issues
-------------------------------------

capybara-webkit depends on a WebKit implementation from Qt, a cross-platform
development toolkit. You'll need to download the Qt libraries to build and
install the gem. You can find instructions for downloading and installing QT on
the
[capybara-webkit wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit).
capybara-webkit requires Qt version 4.8 or greater.

Windows Support
---------------

Currently 32-bit Windows will compile capybara-webkit. Support for Windows is
provided by the open source community and Windows related issues should be
posted to [Stack Overflow].

Reporting Issues
----------------

Without access to your application code we can't easily debug most crashes or
generic failures, so we've included a debug version of the driver that prints a
log of what happened during each test. Before filing a crash bug, please see
[Reporting Crashes]. You're much more likely to get a fix if you follow those
instructions.

If you're having trouble compiling or installing, please check out the [wiki].
If you don't have any luck there, please post to [Stack Overflow]. Please don't
open a Github issue for a system-specific compiler issue.

CI
--

If you're like us, you'll be using capybara-webkit on CI.

On Linux platforms, capybara-webkit requires an X server to run, although it doesn't create any visible windows. Xvfb works fine for this. You can setup Xvfb yourself and set a DISPLAY variable, try out the [headless gem](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless), or use the xvfb-run utility as follows:

```
xvfb-run -a bundle exec spec
```

This automatically sets up a virtual X server on a free server number.

Usage
-----

Add the capybara-webkit gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "capybara-webkit"
```

Set your Capybara Javascript driver to webkit:

```ruby
Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
```

In cucumber, tag scenarios with @javascript to run them using a headless WebKit browser.

In RSpec, use the `:js => true` flag. See the [capybara documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/capybara#Using_Capybara_with_RSpec) for more information about using capybara with RSpec.

Take note of the transactional fixtures section of the [capybara README](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/README.md).

If you're using capybara-webkit with Sinatra, don't forget to set

```ruby
Capybara.app = MySinatraApp.new
```

Configuration
-------------

You can configure global options using `Capybara::Webkit.configure`:

``` ruby
Capybara::Webkit.configure do |config|
  # Enable debug mode. Prints a log of everything the driver is doing.
  config.debug = true

  # By default, requests to outside domains (anything besides localhost) will
  # result in a warning. Several methods allow you to change this behavior.

  # Silently return an empty 200 response for any requests to unknown URLs.
  config.block_unknown_urls

  # Allow pages to make requests to any URL without issuing a warning.
  config.allow_unknown_urls

  # Allow a specific domain without issuing a warning.
  config.allow_url("example.com")

  # Allow a specific URL and path without issuing a warning.
  config.allow_url("example.com/some/path")

  # Wildcards are allowed in URL expressions.
  config.allow_url("*.example.com")

  # Silently return an empty 200 response for any requests to the given URL.
  config.block_url("example.com")

  # Timeout if requests take longer than 5 seconds
  config.timeout = 5

  # Don't raise errors when SSL certificates can't be validated
  config.ignore_ssl_errors

  # Don't load images
  config.skip_image_loading

  # Use a proxy
  config.use_proxy(
    host: "example.com",
    port: 1234,
    user: "proxy",
    pass: "secret"
  )
end
```

These options will take effect for all future sessions and only need to be set
once. It's recommended that you configure these in your `spec_helper.rb` or
`test_helper.rb` rather than a `before` or `setup` block.

Offline Application Cache
-------------------------

The offline application cache needs a directory to write to for the cached files. Capybara-webkit
will look at if the working directory has a tmp directory and when it exists offline application
cache will be enabled.

Non-Standard Driver Methods
---------------------------

capybara-webkit supports a few methods that are not part of the standard capybara API. You can access these by calling `driver` on the capybara session. When using the DSL, that will look like `page.driver.method_name`.

**console_messages**: returns an array of messages printed using console.log

```js
// In Javascript:
console.log("hello")
```

```ruby
# In Ruby:
page.driver.console_messages
=> [{:source=>"http://example.com", :line_number=>1, :message=>"hello"}]
```

**error_messages**: returns an array of Javascript errors that occurred

```ruby
page.driver.error_messages
=> [{:source=>"http://example.com", :line_number=>1, :message=>"SyntaxError: Parse error"}]
```

**cookies**: allows read-only access of cookies for the current session

```ruby
page.driver.cookies["alpha"]
=> "abc"
```

**header**: set the given HTTP header for subsequent requests

```ruby
page.driver.header 'Referer', 'https://www.thoughtbot.com'
```
