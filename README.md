[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit)

A [capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) driver that uses [WebKit](http://webkit.org) via [QtWebKit](http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/QtWebKit).

Qt Dependency and Installation Issues
-------------------------------------

capybara-webkit depends on a WebKit implementation from Qt, a cross-platform
development toolkit. You'll need to download the Qt libraries to build and
install the gem. You can find instructions for downloading and installing QT on
the
[capybara-webkit wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit).
capybara-webkit requires Qt version 4.8 or greater.

Windows Support
---------------

Currently 32-bit Windows will compile capybara-webkit. Support for Windows is
provided by the open source community and Windows related issues should be
posted to [Stack Overflow].

Reporting Issues
----------------

Without access to your application code we can't easily debug most crashes or
generic failures, so we've included a debug version of the driver that prints a
log of what happened during each test. Before filing a crash bug, please see
[Reporting Crashes]. You're much more likely to get a fix if you follow those
instructions.

If you're having trouble compiling or installing, please check out the [wiki].
If you don't have any luck there, please post to [Stack Overflow]. Please don't
open a Github issue for a system-specific compiler issue.

CI
--

If you're like us, you'll be using capybara-webkit on CI.

On Linux platforms, capybara-webkit requires an X server to run, although it doesn't create any visible windows. Xvfb works fine for this. You can setup Xvfb yourself and set a DISPLAY variable, try out the [headless gem](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/headless), or use the xvfb-run utility as follows:

```
xvfb-run -a bundle exec spec
```

This automatically sets up a virtual X server on a free server number.

Usage
-----

Add the capybara-webkit gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "capybara-webkit"
```

Set your Capybara Javascript driver to webkit:

```ruby
Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
```

In cucumber, tag scenarios with @javascript to run them using a headless WebKit browser.

In RSpec, use the `:js => true` flag. See the [capybara documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/capybara#Using_Capybara_with_RSpec) for more information about using capybara with RSpec.

Take note of the transactional fixtures section of the [capybara README](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/README.md).

If you're using capybara-webkit with Sinatra, don't forget to set

```ruby
Capybara.app = MySinatraApp.new
```

Offline Application Cache
-------------------------

The offline application cache needs a directory to write to for the cached files. Capybara-webkit
will look at if the working directory has a tmp directory and when it exists offline application
cache will be enabled.

Non-Standard Driver Methods
---------------------------

capybara-webkit supports a few methods that are not part of the standard capybara API. You can access these by calling `driver` on the capybara session. When using the DSL, that will look like `page.driver.method_name`.

**console_messages**: returns an array of messages printed using console.log

```js
// In Javascript:
console.log("hello")
```

```ruby
# In Ruby:
page.driver.console_messages
=> [{:source=>"http://example.com", :line_number=>1, :message=>"hello"}]
```

**error_messages**: returns an array of Javascript errors that occurred

```ruby
page.driver.error_messages
=> [{:source=>"http://example.com", :line_number=>1, :message=>"SyntaxError: Parse error"}]
```

**cookies**: allows read-only access of cookies for the current session

```ruby
page.driver.cookies["alpha"]
=> "abc"
```

**header**: set the given HTTP header for subsequent requests

```ruby
page.driver.header 'Referer', 'https://www.thoughtbot.com'
```

**block_unknown_urls**: By default, capybara-webkit will warn when a request is made to a URL other than 127.0.0.1 or localhost. This option will block such unknown URLs instead.

```ruby
page.driver.block_unknown_urls
```

**allow_url**: Allow requests to a URL. This will silence unknown URL warnings, or permit requests to a URL when `block_unknown_urls` is used. Allowed URLs are reset on `Driver#reset!`.

```ruby
page.driver.allow_url 'example.com/*.js'
```

**allow_unknown_urls**: Allow requests to all URLs. This will silence unknown URL warnings, or permit requests to all URLs when `block_unknown_urls` is used. Allowed URLs are reset on `Driver#reset!`.

```ruby
page.driver.allow_unknown_urls
```
